Ship is a high-performance client area for the Pterodactyl Panel that allows your users to create, manage and upgrade their servers through an intuitive interface. It was previously sold on Builtbybit, I now decided to make it open source.


## Quick Start Guide

1. Configure the `config.toml` file & customise the dashboard.
2. Set up your SSL certificates and NGINX reverse proxy
3. Install all dependencies using `npm i`
4. Start it using `npm run start` and you're ready to go!
